# IFREMER-ABYSSES
This project aims to build machine learning methods for image classification and semantic segmentation of underwater images in deep environments. Currently, this repository contains just image classification methods designed for substrata characterization. Actually, the repository is still being built since this is a project in progress.

# Substrata classification:
In this item, the proposed framework was devised as depicted in the following figure:

# Pre-requisites:
1- Python 3.7
2- Tensorflow 1.15

Aiming at simplifying Python environment issues, we provide the [docker container](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/psoto87/tf1.15.5-gpu/general) used to conduct the experiments discussed in the paper.

# Dataset
The data used to conduct the experiments reported in the mentioned paper can be assessed through the following [link](https://www.seanoe.org/data/00838/95015/)
